### Testing {#clang-testing}

We believe testing is a part of the development process, so we expect unit and integration tests to be a part of the source code.

~ Must
automatically run unit tests when building your client library.
~

~ Must
maintain a 80% code coverage with unit tests.

~ ToDo
is this even a reasonable ask for testing?
